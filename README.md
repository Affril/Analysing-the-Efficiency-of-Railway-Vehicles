#### To determine the Maximum slope.
#### To determine the force on flange in a curve.
#### To calculate the vertical contact forces for different suspension stiffness on horizontal track of irregular axles.
#### To determine the vertical average speed, average acceleration, average inertia force for a wheel travelling at speed on a irregular profile.
#### To Determine the speed of vehicle running along the curves, where constrains arising from comfort and overturning stability with cant, without cant, and tilt.
#### To determine the installed power, draw the Power vs speed for both axles and draw the force vs speed for resistance, inertial, and traction force.
#### To determine the mass of the locomotive M, capable of pulling a rake of trailing vehicles on a slope with standing start.
#### Construction of T-V curve for diesel engine and determine the power corresponding to maximum rotation speed of the engine.
